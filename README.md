### Skills

- Absorb Spell Energy: You can use your reaction to absorb a level spell that's targeting you.  When you do, you gain 1 spellfire charges per spell level.  If you exceed your total capacity, the excess charges will deal damage in an area around you.
  - Spellfire Discharge: A detonation occurring when you can't contain all the spellfire within you. 
- Spellfire Blast: As an action, you can expend one or more spellfire charges to unleash a spellfire blast at a target within range. The blast requires a ranged spell attack, and on a hit, it deals spellfire damage per charge expended (max 3) and the number of blasts increases at higher levels.  Spellfire damage counts as half Force and half Fire damage.
- Spellfire Smite: As an bonus action, you can expend one or more spellfire charges to unleash a spellfire smite at a target within range. The smite requires a weapon attack, and on a hit, it deals spellfire damage per charge expended (max 3).  Spellfire damage counts as half Force and half Fire damage.
- Spellfire Healing: As an action, you can touch a creature and expend one spellfire charge to heal it.  This healing is not positive energy and does not harm undead, thus it can be used to heal undead and constructs.
- Spellfire Flight: You expend spellfire charges to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute.
- Counterspellfire: As a reaction, you can expend a spellfire charge to attempt to counter another spell without absorbing it.
- Spellfire Conversion: You can convert a certain number of spellfire charges to one Spell Slot of the corresponding level.
- Create Spellfire Charge: You can create a spellfire charge once per long rest, absorbing a portion of your own magical power instead of spells targeting you.
