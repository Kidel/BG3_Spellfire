### Features

#### Spellfire Wielder

You have gained mastery over spellfire, a rare and potent gift from Mystra that makes you able to wield raw magical energy.  You can obtain Spellfire Charges by absorbing magic from your opponents or yourself.  Whether healing allies, devastating foes, or drawing power from other spells, your control over spellfire makes you a formidable force on the battlefield. 

- Absorb Spell Energy: You can use your reaction to absorb a level spell that's targeting you.  When you do, you gain 1 spellfire charges per spell level.  If you exceed your total capacity, the excess charges will deal damage in an area around you.
  - Spellfire Discharge: A detonation occurring when you can't contain all the spellfire within you. 
- Spellfire Blast: As an action, you can expend one or more spellfire charges to unleash a spellfire blast at a target within range. The blast requires a ranged spell attack, and on a hit, it deals spellfire damage per charge expended (max 3) and the number of blasts increases at higher levels.  Spellfire damage counts as half Force and half Fire damage.
- Spellfire Smite: As an bonus action, you can expend one or more spellfire charges to unleash a spellfire smite at a target within range. The smite requires a weapon attack, and on a hit, it deals spellfire damage per charge expended (max 3).  Spellfire damage counts as half Force and half Fire damage.
- Spellfire Healing: As an action, you can touch a creature and expend one spellfire charge to heal it.  This healing is not positive energy and does not harm undead, thus it can be used to heal undead and constructs.
- Spellfire Flight: You expend spellfire charges to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute.
- Counterspellfire: As a reaction, you can expend a spellfire charge to attempt to counter another spell without absorbing it.
- Spellfire Conversion: You can convert a certain number of spellfire charges to one Spell Slot of the corresponding level.
- Create Spellfire Charge: You can create a spellfire charge once per long rest, absorbing a portion of your own magical power instead of spells targeting you.
- Crown of Fire: The wielder can summon the crown of fire to nullify any magic in an area except from other spellfier wielders.
